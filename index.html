      Using String Methods In JavaScript, regular expressions are often used
      with the two string methods: search() and replace(). The search() method
      uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the
      match. The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern is
      replaced.

    <p>
      i Perform case-insensitive matching g Perform a global match (find all) m
      Perform multiline matching d Perform start and end matching
    </p>
    <p>
      Expression Description [abc] Find any of the characters between the
      brackets [0-9] Find any of the digits between the brackets (x|y) Find any
      of the alternatives separated with |
    </p>
    <p>
      Metacharacter Description \d Find a digit \s Find a whitespace character
      \b Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD, or at the
      end of a word like this: WORD\b \uxxxx Find the Unicode character
      specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx Quantifiers define quantities:
      Quantifier Description n+ Matches any string that contains at least one n
      n* Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n n?
      Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

      The test() method is a RegExp expression method. It searches a string for
      a pattern, and returns true or false, depending on the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using exec() The exec() method is a RegExp expression method. It searches
      a string for a specified pattern, and returns the found text as an object.
      If no match is found, it returns an empty (null) object.
